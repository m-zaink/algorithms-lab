Depth First Search

Technique : Brute Force
Efficiency : O(v + e) in adjacency list, O(v^2) in adjacency matrix


Input : Graph (V, E)
Output : The order in which vertices were visited

Depth Fist Search (Start)
mark all vertices in V with 0 to indicate unvisited.
count = 0
for each vertex v in V 
    if v is marked with 0
        dfs(v)


dfs(v) {
    count++
    for each vertex w in V adjacent to V
        if w is marked with 0
            dfs(w)
}
