Breadth First Search 

Technique : Brute Force
Efficiency : O(v + e) in AL, O(v^2) in AM

Input : Graph (V, E)
Output : Order in which the vertices were visited.

Breadth First Search(Start)

mark all vertices in V with 0, indicating not visited
count = 0;
for each vertex v in V {
    if(v is marked with 0) {   
        bfs(v)
    }
}


bfs(v) {
    count++;
    mark v with count and initialise a queue with v
    while the queue is not empty {
        for each vertex w in V adjacent to the front vertex
            if w is marked with 0
                count ++
                mark w with count
                add w to the qeueu
        
        remove the front vertex from the queue
    }
}
